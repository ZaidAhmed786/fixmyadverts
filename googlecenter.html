                            <p class="mt-3 px-2" style="font-size: 16px;" >One of the common reasons for Google merchant center suspension is policy violations, such as providing inaccurate product information. This could include misleading descriptions, incorrect pricing, or failing to meet the requirements for product data quality set by Google, and this results in suspended Google Merchant Center. For instance, if a product's price on your website doesn't match what's listed in your feed, it can lead to suspension. Another reason why your Google Merchant account suspended is mismatched availability between what's displayed on your website and what you submit to Google. If a customer tries to purchase an item from your site but finds out it's actually out of stock when they arrive at the checkout page, this can result in a violation.</p>
